    "bio": "Hi there! I am Chloe. Since I am a SAIT graduate, I am trying to discover a new, unique world. Although I am not sure of my future and what will happen, I will continue to dream big and far. I lack experience when it comes to being professional. Nevertheless, I have a plan for every step I take in my path, and I constantly try my best to teach myself many different and new technologies. I am a fast learner, and I try my hardest, no matter the circumstances. I enjoy helping others out and using my abilities to my limit within the team. I am a positive person, a person that is easy to communicate with. I know when to listen to others and when to speak. I am open to new ideas and thoughts that are shared.",

Taking care of her big family, itâ€™s hard to understand how she manages her time, but she does it magically. She has a big heart and treats her team members just like her family.
